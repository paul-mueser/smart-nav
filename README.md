# SmartNav

## General

This is a simple train navigation app for Android.
It uses the [Deutsche Bahn Timetables API](https://developers.deutschebahn.com/db-api-marketplace/apis/product/26497) to
get the train connections.
The app is still in development and not yet ready for daily use.

## Features

Currently, all features are still in development.

## Developing

To further develop the app, you need to set up environment variables in your system.
Which variables are needed can be found in the example.env file.
For that you need an API key from the Deutsche Bahn API.
You also need an Android SDK installed on your system and a keystore file to sign the app.
